# Ants vs. Some-Bees

This module is a simple turn-based tower-defense game played on the command-line, created for the Software Architecture course at the UW iSchool.  The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!  

##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Microsoft's typedoc documentation and around 4 youtube videos describing how to actually use the typedoc software.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 4


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 5. This assignment was only difficult due to the lack of instruction on how to use typedoc or what it was. After teaching it to myself though, TypeDoc is wonderful. 


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> The installation of typedoc dramatically hindered the learning process. Additionally, instruct students on what comments you want to see with examples, not just the java library online.
